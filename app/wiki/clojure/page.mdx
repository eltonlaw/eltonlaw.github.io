Clojure is a functional, Lisp-style programming language. There are compilers for Javascript, C# and the JVM.

There are lots of ways of changing a few data structures, if you can represent your data in some combination of maps, vectors etc. you instantly get alot of functionallity from just `clojure.core` available to operate on that data. Interop between smaller libraries is generally pretty simple. People are able to write highly specialized libraries that do just a single thing and spit it back out in a form that anyone can parse.

The REPL is one of the most attractive parts of using Clojure.
