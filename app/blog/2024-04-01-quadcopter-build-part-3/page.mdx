By default, the SAM-M10Q is configured using a UART bus with the UBX protocol. It's an 8-bit binary protocol described in this [Interface Description] document.

Also described, the calculation for CK_A and CK_B is some basic arithmetic over the unique bits of the message:

```
CK_A = 0, CK_B = 0
For (I = 0; I < N; I++)
{
CK_A = CK_A + Buffer[I]
CK_B = CK_B + CK_A
}
```

`UBX-MON-VER` is a UBX protocol in class `MON` that returns version information and is a polled message type.

Messages are polled by sending a request, which the receiver will respond with the same message populated.
